<!-- <p>Where the creation of a music video can be quite costly when accounting for all factors such as travel, actors and more, we have devised a method which allows us to create music videos at absolutely no extra expense to the artist. The way we go about this is by reinvesting some of our profits into a music video budget. However, although we are open minded to any genre (providing it has right vibe), a music video is not an easy feature to obtain which means tracks which we create one for will be carefully selected by <b>Sore Thumb Media!</b></p>

<p>On the other hand, we love to get out the office and travel, so should you receive a music video, we'd like to involve the artist on a more personal level if possible. From discussing video idea's with them, to even travelling to their location and featuring them in the video. So, if you believe your music deserves to be heard, send in your best demo today!</p> -->
