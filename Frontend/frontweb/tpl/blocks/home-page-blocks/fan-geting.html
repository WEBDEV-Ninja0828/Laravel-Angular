	        	<p>If you are unaware of what fan gating is, it's the process which allows listeners to download an artists track at no expense other than supporting them. This is completed by carrying out steps such as following them on their preferred social platform (i.e. Soundcloud) in order to unlock the download to their track. This is called a gated track.
				</p>
				<p class="top-margin"></p>
				<p>If you are accepted as a Sore Thumb Media artist, you will gain access to a free profile which you can host 5 of your gated tracks to test the waters. Subscription options will be available should you want to upgrade the amount of gated tracks hosted on your profile.</p>

				<h3 class="sub-title">Social platforms which our gating service supports include:</h3>
				<p>
					<ul class="model-list">
						<li>Soundcloud</li>
						<li>Facebook</li>
						<li>Twitter</li>
						<li>Youtube</li>
						<li>Instagram</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>This method is managed by yourself as an artist, however, Sore Thumb Media can become more involved in promoting your music via our bespoke <strong>promotional services</strong>.
