        		<p>Many artists are familiar with reposting on Soundcloud as a form of promotion, which can be a great way of getting your music out there... but wouldn't you like more than this?</p>

				<p>Although this is a feature that Sore Thumb Media can offer, our aim is to direct a fresh audience to our site where more promotional attractions can be found and also where you can build a whole new network of fans. We will actively push tracks and even feature those which we believe stick out like a sore thumb. Furthermore, we hope to ultimately become a bridge between an outstanding artist and record labels which could kick off the start of a musical career.</p>

				<h3 class="sub-title">We currently offer:</h3>
				<p>
					<ul class="model-list">
						<li>A music discovery section</li>
						<li>Remix competitions</li>
						<li>Sore Thumb Media releases</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
        <p>and finally, for the very best track submissions we receive, we will offer a <strong>music video</strong> service.</p>
