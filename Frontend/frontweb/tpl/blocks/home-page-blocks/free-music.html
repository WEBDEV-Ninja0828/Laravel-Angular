        		<p>Here at Sore Thumb Media, we want to be renowned as the go-to place for free music by up-coming, electronic music artists.</p> 
        		<h3 class="sub-title"> Here's how it works:</h3>
				<p>Our hand-picked artists upload their free music, waiting for listeners like you to download them. Once you have selected the 'Free Download' button underneath a track, you will be redirected to a page where you can then download it. However, in order to do this, you will be required to follow the artist on social platforms of their choice i.e. Soundcloud, Facebook. This will then 'unlock' the download button and you are free to enjoy your track!</p><br>
				<p>However, if you are someone who prefers to stream their music, there is an option to add a track onto a playlist on your profile for you to enjoy whenever you like. Whichever way you choose, explore the site and <b>discover new artists</b>.</p>
