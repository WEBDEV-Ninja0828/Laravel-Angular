        		<p>With music streaming sites clogging up your feed with repost after repost, it can become difficult to find the music that you really like. That's why at Sore Thumb Media we want you to see the activity of the artists that you're following, because when you follow a specific artist, you purely want to hear their music.</p><br>
				<p>Music production is becoming so popular that the industry is becoming saturated. There are so many artists out there that you may not ever hear, so, Sore Thumb Media has opened the doors to up-and-coming talented artists for you guys to discover.</p>
